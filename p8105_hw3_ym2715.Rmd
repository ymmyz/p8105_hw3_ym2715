## Problem 1

```{r import data and do some cleaning}
brfss_smart2010 = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010

brfss_overall_health = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr) %>% 
  select(year, state, location_desc = locationdesc, topic, response, data_value) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") %>% 
  arrange(factor(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
```
Question 1

```{r problem1_q1}
brfss_overall_health %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  distinct(location_desc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  mutate(location_num = n()) %>% 
  distinct(state, location_num) %>% 
  filter(location_num == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("State", "Number of locations"), align = "c")  
```
  
  In 2002, CT, FL, NC were observed at 7 locations.  
    
  Question 2
```{r problem1_q2}
spaghetti = brfss_overall_health %>% 
  select(year, state, location_desc) %>% 
  distinct(year, location_desc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  mutate(location_num = n()) %>% 
  distinct(year, state, location_num)

ggplot(spaghetti, aes(x= year, y = location_num, color = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of locations in each state",
    y = "Number of locations",
    x = "Year",
    caption = "Data from the brfss package"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```
  
  Question 3  
  
```{r problem1_q3}
ny_response = brfss_overall_health %>% 
  filter(state == "NY" & response == "Excellent") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2002, 2006, 2010)) 

ny_mean = aggregate(ny_response[, 6], list(ny_response$location_desc), mean) %>% 
  rename(mean = data_value, location = Group.1)
ny_sd = aggregate(ny_response[, 6], list(ny_response$location_desc), sd) %>% 
  rename(sd = data_value, location = Group.1)
ny_mean_sd = left_join(ny_mean, ny_sd, by = "location") %>% 
  mutate(mean = round(mean, digits = 1), sd = round(sd, digits = 2))

knitr::kable(ny_mean_sd, format = "html", align = "l", caption = "Mean and sd of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State")
```

## Problem2
```{r}
instacart = p8105.datasets::instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
  
  Question 1  
  
```{r problem2_q1}
aisle_order = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  mutate(order_count = n()) %>% 
  select(aisle, order_count) %>% 
  distinct(aisle, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(order_count))
```

  There are 134 aisles, and fresh vegetables is the onr that most items ordered from.  
  
  Question 2

```{r problem2_q2}

```

  Question 3  

```{r problem2_q3}
popular_item = instacart %>% 
  select(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(item_count = n()) %>% 
  distinct(product_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, product_name) 

popular_item %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(max_item_name = product_name[which.max(item_count)], max_item_count = max(item_count)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html",col.names = c("Aisle", "Most popular item", "Count"), align = "l", caption = "Most popular item in these three aisles")

```
  
  Question 4 
  
```{r problem2_q4}
apple_and_ice = instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour = order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  group_by(order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour)) %>% 
  mutate(mean_hour = round(mean_hour, digits = 1)) 

apple_and_ice$order_dow = recode(apple_and_ice$order_dow, 
                                 "0" = "Sunday",
                                 "1" = "Monday",
                                 "2" = "Tuesday",
                                 "3" = "Wednesday",
                                 "4" = "Thursday",
                                 "5" = "Friday",
                                 "6" = "Saturday")

apple_and_ice %>% 
  rename(day_of_week = order_dow,
         order_time = mean_hour) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html",col.names = c("Day of a week", "Average clock time of order"), align = "c", caption = "Average clock that Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered")
```

## Problem3

```{r}
ny_noaa_raw = p8105.datasets::ny_noaa
```

```{r problem3_q1}
ny_noaa = ny_noaa_raw %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), spe = "-") %>% 
  mutate(prcp = prcp / 10,
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10,
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10)

ny_noaa %>% 
  group_by(snow) %>% 
  mutate(snow_count = n()) %>% 
  distinct(snow, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(snow_count)) %>% 
  head(1)
```
For snowfall, 0 is the most commonly observed values, because it doesn't snow in most time of a year in New York.

```{r problem3_q2}
tmax_jan_jul = ny_noaa %>% 
  select(id, year, month, tmax) %>% 
  na.omit(tmax) %>% 
  filter(month == "01" | month == "07" ) %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  summarise(max = max(tmax))

tmax_jan_jul$month = recode(tmax_jan_jul$month,
                            "01" = "January",
                            "07" = "July")

ggplot(tmax_jan_jul, aes(x = year, y = max) ) +
  geom_hex() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1980, 2010, by = 5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Maximum temperature in New York",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r problem3_q3}
tmax_vs_tmin = ny_noaa %>% 
  select(tmax, tmin) %>% 
  na.omit(tmax, tmin)

tmax_vs_tmin_graph = ggplot(tmax_vs_tmin, aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +
  theme_bw()

snowfall_df = ny_noaa %>% 
  select(year, snow) %>% 
  na.omit(snow) %>% 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100)
