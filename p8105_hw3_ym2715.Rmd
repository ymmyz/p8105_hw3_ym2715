```

## Problem 1

```{r import data and do some cleaning}
brfss_smart2010 = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010

brfss_overall_health = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr) %>% 
  select(year, state, location_desc = locationdesc, topic, response, data_value) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") %>% 
  arrange(factor(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
```
Question 1

```{r problem1_q1}
brfss_overall_health %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  distinct(location_desc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  mutate(location_num = n()) %>% 
  distinct(state, location_num) %>% 
  filter(location_num == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()  
```
  
  In 2002, CT, FL, NC were observed at 7 locations.

```{r problem1_q2}
spaghetti = brfss_overall_health %>% 
  select(year, state, location_desc) %>% 
  distinct(year, location_desc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  mutate(location_num = n()) %>% 
  distinct(year, state, location_num)

ggplot(spaghetti, aes(x= year, y = location_num, color = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

```{r problem1_q3}
ny_response = brfss_overall_health %>% 
  filter(state == "NY" & response == "Excellent") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2002, 2006, 2010)) 

ny_mean = aggregate(ny_response[, 6], list(ny_response$location_desc), mean) %>% 
  rename(mean = data_value, location = Group.1)
ny_sd = aggregate(ny_response[, 6], list(ny_response$location_desc), sd) %>% 
  rename(sd = data_value, location = Group.1)
ny_mean_sd = left_join(ny_mean, ny_sd, by = "location")

knitr::kable(ny_mean_sd)
```

## Problem3
```{r}
instacart = p8105.datasets::instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

```{r problem3_q1}
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  mutate(aisle_count = n()) %>% 
  select(aisle, aisle_count) %>% 
  distinct(aisle, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(aisle_count))
```
